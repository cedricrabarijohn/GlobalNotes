- VARIABLES :
    ex: var name = 'Bob';
        Object name = 'Bob';
        String name = 'Bob';

    . Initialized variables that have nullable type have an initial value of null. Even variables with numeric types are
      initially null, because numbers are Objects too
        ex: int? lineCount;
            assert(lineCount == null);
    
        NOTE : Production code ignores the assert() call. During the development, assert(condition) throws an exception
               if condition is false.
    
    . If you enable null safety, then you must initialize the values of non-nullable variables before you use them:
        int lineCount = 0;
    
    . Initializing a local variable is not needed during its declaration, but should be declared before using it.

- LATE VARIABLES : (Dart 2.12)
    . Declaring a non-nullable variable that's initialized after its declaration
    . Lazily initializing a variable
        ex :
            late String description;

            void main(){
                description = 'Feijoada!';
                print(description);
            }

- FINAL and CONST:  
    . Final variable can be set only once (you can't change its value)
    . Const variable is a compile-time constant (Const variables are implicitly final)
        NOTE : Instance variables can be final but not const
        
        - Examples of Final variables : final name = "Bob";
                                     final String nickname = "Bobby";
        - Examples of Const variables : const bar = 1 000 000;
                                        const double atm = 1.01325 * bar;
    . const keyword can also be used to create constant values
        - Examples : 
                var foo = const[];
                final bar = const[];
                const baz = []; //Equivalent to 'const[]'
    . You can change the value of a non-final, non-const variable, even if it used to have a const value
        - Example : foo = [1,2,3];

    . You can define constants that use type checks and casts (is and as), collection if, and spread operators(... and ...?)
        - Examples :
            const Object i = 3;
            const list = [i as int]; //Use a typecast.
            const map = { if (i is int) i:'int' }; // Use is and collection if.
            const set = { if (list is List<int>) ...list }; // ... and a spread.

- BUILT-IN TYPES:
    The Dart language has special support for the following :
        Numbers (int, double)
        Strings (String)
        Booleans (bool)
        Lists (List, also known as arrays)
        Sets (Set)
        Maps (Map)
        Runes (Runes: often replaced by the characters API)
        Symbols (Symbol)
        The value null (Null)

- Installation (Admin mode) :  choco install dart-sdk
- Create a small app : dart create -t console cli
   ===> Note: Under the hood, dart create runs dart pub get, which scans the generated pubspec file and downloads dependencies. 
    If you add other dependencies to your pubspec file, then run dart pub get to download them.
- Run the app : dart run
